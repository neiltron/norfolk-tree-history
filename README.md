# norfolk-tree-history

Tracking the history of trees in Norfolk.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of Simon Willison's [sf-tree-history](https://github.com/simonw/sf-tree-history) repo with only minor changes. It's an excuse for me to learn more about using github actions for automated data processing tasks. It only has minor changes for now but the goal is to modify it, add features, and base future repos/projects on learnings from this.

Background: [Generating a commit log for San Franciscoâ€™s official list of trees](https://simonwillison.net/2019/Mar/13/tree-history/). See also [Git Scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) for a description of the general technique.

This repository [uses GitHub Actions](https://github.com/simonw/sf-tree-history/actions) to retrieve the [official CSV file of trees in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Street-Tree-List/tkzw-k3nq) once a day and track any changes to it over time using the git commit history.

It uses [csv-diff](https://github.com/simonw/csv-diff) to generate human-readable commit messages.

You can see recent changes to the CSV file here: https://github.com/simonw/sf-tree-history/commits/main
